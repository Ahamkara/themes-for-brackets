FAQ
==================
* Another Brackets extension already adds themes, why make another one?
  - The [Bracket themes](https://raw.github.com/MiguelCastillo/Brackets-Themes/) extension only styles the editor, while this extension styles all components of Brackets. Furthermore it adds other themes than just the CodeMirror onces.
* Can I make my own theme?
 - Shure thing, all you need to do is make a new css file in the themes/ folder, and add it to main.js in the Themes.allThemes array.<br/>I would recommend looking at already existing themes to find ids and classes.
