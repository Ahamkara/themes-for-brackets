###We reccommend the following brackets extensions to aid in debugging:

* https://github.com/cfjedimaster/brackets-csslint
* https://github.com/mikaeljorhult/brackets-todo
* https://github.com/dsbonev/whitespace-normalizer

###Coding Guidelines:

* Please use 4 spaces instead of tabs.
* Make sure there is a new line at the end of the file.
* Install csslint extension and make sure there are no errors.

###How to use csslint

1. Clone the git repository https://github.com/Jacse/themes-for-brackets.git
2. In brackets select open folder and open the themes-for-brackets folder that contains this CONTRIBUTING.md and the .csslintrc file
3. With .csslintrc in the root folder and the extension installed in brackets it will now work!
